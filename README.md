# Introduction
In this project, I'll attempt to make an electric skateboard from scratch. I will need to improve my skills handling hardware in a real, environment, built to resist harsh weather and wear over time

I will document my process in the **diary** directory, where I'll explain every step I take in making this project.

Other directories will work as extra information, useful for the project.
- **Components** -> I'll document in depth which components I use.
- **Media** -> This directory will work as visual representation of my process in this project.
