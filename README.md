# DIY Electric Skateboard Project

## Current state
✅ First version working – hub motor, ESC and battery already mounted and tested.  
The board runs, turns, and has been tested in a first ride.  
Still missing: proper charger and external cover for daily use.  

## Introduction
In this project, I'll attempt to make an electric skateboard from scratch.  
My goal is to improve my hardware skills while creating something that can resist wear over time.  
It's also really important that I try to piece everything together, not only following instructions or pre-made kits.  

I will document my process in the **`diary/`** directory, where I'll share every step, challenge and lesson learned during the build.  

Other directories will provide extra information for the project:  
- **`media/`** → Photos and videos that visually represent the progress.
