# DIY Electric Skateboard Project

## Current state
âœ… **Build v1 complete â€“ fully functional longboard setup.**  
The board runs smoothly and has been tested on multiple rides.  
Electronics (hub motor, ESC, and battery) are mounted in two separate project boxes under the deck.  
The system is reliable and easy to maintain â€” only the charger is pending.  

## Introduction
In this project, I built an electric skateboard completely from scratch.  
My goal was to improve my hardware skills while creating something durable and practical for daily use.  
Instead of following a ready-made kit, I wanted to learn by assembling every component myself â€” wiring, fitting, drilling, and problem solving.  

The project evolved from a small 56 cm cruiser to a **longboard**, improving stability and comfort at speed.  
I learned how small mechanical and electrical decisions affect balance, power, and ride quality.  

All progress and reflections are documented in the **`diary/`** folder.  
Each entry covers a key step of the build:  
1. Research and initial component selection.  
2. Buying and testing parts.  
3. Mounting and first tests.  
4. Switching to the longboard base.  
5. Final assembly and results.

## Reflection
This project taught me much more than I expected â€” from basic drilling and cable routing to power management and stability tuning.  
Itâ€™s a mix of electronics, mechanics, and creativity: a real hands-on build that pushed me to understand every part of the system.  

The board now works perfectly for my short daily route to university.  
Future improvements could include a custom 3D-printed enclosure, a better charger, and a more powerful motor or ESC.
