# DIY Electric Skateboard Project
## Current state
🚧 Project in progress – starting research and component selection. 🚧

## Introduction
In this project, I'll attempt to make an electric skateboard from scratch.
My goal is to improve my hardware skills while creating something that can resist harsh weather and wear over time. It's also really important that I try to piece everything together, not only following instructions or pre-made kits.

I will document my process in the **`diary/`** directory, where I'll share every step, challenge and lesson learned during the build.


Other directories will work as extra information, useful for the project.
- **`components/`** → In-depth documentation of the parts I choose and use.  
- **`media/`** → Photos and videos that visually represent the progress.
