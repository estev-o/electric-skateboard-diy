## Final pick
For the first version of this project, I decided to go with the **Empire cruiser** Option 2.  

The main reasons are:  
- Low cost  
- Good condition 
- Longboard-style wheels  
- Portability  
- Challenge (fit electronics)

Limitations:  
- Reduced stability compared to a longboard, especially at higher speeds.  
- Less room for battery and ESC, which may limit range.    

This choice reflects the learning-driven nature of the project: start small, cheap, and challenging — and evolve later if needed.

# Battery

# ESC
A good idea is to buy a regular ESC + controller in Aliexpress. It's around 60€
# Mount, pulley system
# External Cover
