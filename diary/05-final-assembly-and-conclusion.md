## Mounting the boxes
With all the materials ready, I installed the two project boxes under the longboard:
- The **larger one** (160Ã—90Ã—60 mm) holds the battery.
- The **smaller one** (115Ã—85Ã—35 mm) holds the ESC.

I drilled the holes using a 4 mm drill bit, going slowly to avoid cracking the plastic.  
Between each box and the deck I placed a thin foam strip, so the plastic doesnâ€™t touch the wood directly.  
Both boxes are fixed with **M4Ã—25 mm bolts, washers, and nylock nuts**.

Inside each box:
- The **battery** is held with industrial velcro and surrounded by foam padding to absorb vibration.  
- The **ESC** is attached with double-sided 3M tape.  
- Cables are guided with zip ties and the **XT60 connector** stays accessible between both boxes, so I can disconnect it when charging or storing the board.

## Result
After moving everything to the longboard, the ride feels much more stable.  
The extra space under the deck allowed a cleaner setup, and the two-box solution works well.  
Itâ€™s easy to disconnect the battery for charging, and the boxes protect everything while riding.

## Others
- Bought the **42V 2A charger** for the 10S2P battery.  

## Reflection
This project started with a small cruiser and evolved into a fully working longboard electric skateboard.  
I learned a lot about wiring, mounting, and solving small mechanical problems with limited tools.  
The result isnâ€™t perfect, but itâ€™s reliable and rides well â€” which was exactly the goal.

ðŸŽ¥ At the end, I recorded a video where I talk about the whole process, from the first idea to the final ride.
