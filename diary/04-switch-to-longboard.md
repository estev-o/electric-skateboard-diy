# Switching to Longboard

## Change
I switched the base from a small cruiser (56 cm) to a longboard.  
This gave the build much more stability, better comfort at speed, and extra space under the deck for components.  
The trade-off is weight: the longboard setup is heavier, so climbs will be harder for a 350W hub motor.  

## Current issues
- The battery and ESC need a proper enclosure.  
- Because the battery charges through the XT60 connector, I cannot put everything inside a single box.  
- I will need two separate boxes (one for the battery, one for the ESC), with the XT60 cable accessible between them.
