# Switching to Longboard

## Change
I switched the base from a small cruiser (56 cm) to a longboard.  
This gave the build much more stability, better comfort at speed, and extra space under the deck for components.  
The trade-off is weight: the longboard setup is heavier, so climbs will be harder for a 350W hub motor.  

## Current issues
- The battery and ESC need a proper enclosure.  
- Because the battery charges through the XT60 connector, I cannot put everything inside a single box.  
- I will need two separate boxes (one for the battery, one for the ESC), with the XT60 cable accessible between them.  

## Next steps
- Use double sided tape or velcro to fix ESC and battery inside the boxes.  
- Add foam padding to reduce vibration and hold everything in place.  
- Cut and mount project boxes under the longboard deck.  
- Drill holes for screws to secure the boxes to the wood.  
- Buy a 42V 2A charger for the 10S2P battery.
