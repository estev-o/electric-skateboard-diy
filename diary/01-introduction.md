# Researching about the topic
The first step is crucial. Finding information online about DIY electric skateboards is not difficult.

I mainly used two videos ([video1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5kOgzW5Jmc&list=WL&index=27&t=59s)) ([video2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPWvdvJii_0&list=WL&index=28)) to find information
# Components
1. Skateboard, either a complete one or
	1. Deck
	2. Grip tape
	3. Trucks
	4. Wheels 
	5. Bearings
	6. Riser pads
2. Motor
	They all work similarly, they have a shaft that you attach to a pulley, and then to a belt (which pulls the skate).
	They have 3 phase wires and a sensor wire.
3. Motor mounts
	Usually there's a clamp and a mount
4. Pulley system that transfers the movement that the motor produces to the skate's wheels
5. Battery
	We need a battery that's powerful enough for our purpose
6. ESC (Electronic Speed Controller)
	It's usually best to choose one that already has a remote that we can use.
## What I learned
- Rather that the skates shown in the video, I plan to buy only what I need, and make my own system. Maybe risking durability but staying true to the DIY part of the project
- The most important parts seem to be the Skate, Battery and ESC
# Requirements
This is the first and the most crucial step; finding the best skateboard for my use case. 

The skateboard should be:
- suitable for moving around the city (asphalt with some hills)
- No need for high speed (20km/h)
- Or really long battery life (10km)
- Furthermore, it shouldn't be a traditional skate, built for tricks and quick turns, it should prioritize stability.
- The budget is around 200â‚¬
# Selecting compontents
## Skate
For this project, we will buy a used skateboard. Maybe some sort of longboard-style small skate.
## ESC
**Keep in mind the max amperage of the ESC**. Minimum would be 50 A continuous or 240 A Max.

**Keep in mind the max voltage of the ESC**. A battery like 10S it's great for our use case.
### VESC or ESC:
VESC tend to be more customizable, with better components. ESC tend to be more easy to use and more plug and play, but you are limited to the capabilities it comes with.
