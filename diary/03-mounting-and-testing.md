# Mounting and Testing

## Mounting
I installed the hub motor + truck on the back.  
At first I didn’t tighten it too much, so it feels more loose than before.  
It is not a bad thing, the skate now turns easier and is more controllable, but less stable at speed.  
The ESC and battery are still mounted in a temporary way, without a proper cover.  

## Wiring
The hub motor came with the 3 phase wires and the hall sensor cable.  
I connected everything to the ESC:  
- Motor phases + hall sensor  
- Battery XT60  
The switch and battery indicator also worked after wiring.  

## First Power On
The first time, the remote was on but the motor didn’t spin.  
This was a pairing issue between the ESC and the remote.  
After checking the LEDs and trying again, it finally worked.  
The battery has no dedicated charging port, so it needs to be disconnected from the ESC to charge. Right now I don’t have the charger, only the battery pack itself.  

## First Ride Test
I recorded a video of the first ride, and I talk about the experience there.  
The skate moves, accelerates, and brakes with the remote.  
It feels smaller and less stable than a longboard, but still manageable.  
The loose truck on the back makes it turn more, which helps with control.  
Power is enough for flat ground, even if it’s only a 350W motor.
But when it's too steep, it struggles quite a bit

## Next Steps
- Buy a charger (42V, 2A) to use the battery daily.  
- Design a proper cover for ESC + battery.  
- Test the range in my daily route to university.
